# Flask Fyyur v2024

## Introduction
Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows. First project from Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program - Udacity


## Overview
This app is nearly complete. It is only missing one thingâ€¦ real data! While the views and controllers are defined in this application, it is missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. By the end of this project, you should have a fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:

- creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
- searching for venues and artists.
- learning more about a specific artist or venue.

We want Fyyur to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!
